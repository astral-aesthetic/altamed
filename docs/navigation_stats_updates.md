**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Deployed URL:** https://1ipr6ap0ff87.space.minimax.io

---

## Task Overview

Implemented two user experience improvements:
1. Fixed "Learn More" button navigation on the homepage
2. Updated patient count statistics to reflect accurate numbers

---

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Learn More Button Navigation Fix

**File:** `atlamed/src/pages/LandingPage.tsx`

**Issue:** The "Learn More" button on the homepage was a non-functional `<button>` element that didn't navigate anywhere.

**Solution:** Converted the button to a React Router `<Link>` component that navigates to the `/our-story` page.

**Before:**
```tsx
<button className="inline-flex items-center justify-center bg-white text-slate-700 px-8 py-4 rounded-2xl font-semibold border-2 border-slate-200 hover:border-blue-300 hover:shadow-lg transition-all">
  Learn More
</button>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<Link
  to="/our-story"
  className="inline-flex items-center justify-center bg-white text-slate-700 px-8 py-4 rounded-2xl font-semibold border-2 border-slate-200 hover:border-blue-300 hover:shadow-lg transition-all"
>
  Learn More
</Link>
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Users can now click "Learn More" to learn about AtlaMed's mission
- ✅ Improved user navigation flow from homepage to Our Story page
- ✅ Uses proper React Router navigation for client-side routing
- ✅ Maintains all existing styling and hover effects

---

### 2. Patient Count Update

**File:** `atlamed/src/pages/OurStoryPage.tsx`

**Issue:** The patient count displayed "50K+ patients connected" which didn't reflect accurate statistics.

**Solution:** Updated the count to "1K+" to show realistic, accurate numbers.

**Before:**
```tsx
<div className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-1">50K+</div>
<div className="text-slate-600">Patients Connected</div>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<div className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-1">1K+</div>
<div className="text-slate-600">Patients Connected</div>
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Statistics now reflect accurate patient connection numbers
- ✅ Maintains credibility with realistic metrics
- ✅ Preserves all styling and visual design
- ✅ Consistent with the platform's growth stage
