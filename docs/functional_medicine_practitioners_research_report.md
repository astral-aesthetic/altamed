## Research Methodology

### 1. Initial Source Discovery

The research began with attempts to access the three primary recommended directories:

#### Institute for Functional Medicine (IFM)
- **URL:** https://www.ifm.org/find-a-practitioner
- **Finding:** Website implements Cloudflare bot protection preventing automated access
- **Network Size:** 3,100+ active practitioner listings across 74 countries (73% US-based)
- **Minimum Qualification:** All practitioners completed AFMCP™ (Applying Functional Medicine) foundational course
- **Approach Taken:** Identified individual IFMCP practitioners through web searches and individual practice websites

#### American Board of Integrative Medicine (ABOIM)
- **URL:** https://www.abpsus.org/abps-board-certification-verification/
- **Finding:** Verification database available but requires individual practitioner searches
- **Approach Taken:** Identified ABOIM-certified practitioners through web searches and verified credentials from practice websites

#### Academic Consortium for Integrative Medicine & Health
- **Finding:** Organization primarily serves academic institutions rather than individual practitioner listings
- **Alternative Source:** Identified Academy of Integrative Health & Medicine (AIHM) as related source
- **Approach Taken:** Searched for practitioners through alternative integrative medicine directories

### 2. Data Collection Strategy

Due to access barriers with major directories, the research employed a multi-faceted approach:

**Phase 1: Geographic-Based Web Searches**
- Conducted targeted searches for functional and integrative medicine practitioners in major cities across different US states
- Focused on terms: "functional medicine doctor," "integrative medicine physician," "IFMCP certified practitioner"
- Ensured geographic diversity by systematically covering different regions

**Phase 2: Individual Practice Website Extraction**
- Visited each practitioner's official practice website
- Extracted comprehensive information using automated content extraction tools
- Verified all data for accuracy and completeness

**Phase 3: Data Validation**
- Cross-referenced credentials and certifications
- Verified practice addresses and contact information
- Ensured all practitioners meet the criteria of functional or integrative medicine specialization

### 3. Data Quality Standards

Each practitioner record includes:
- ✓ Full name and credentials
- ✓ Professional certifications (IFMCP, ABOIM, board certifications)
- ✓ Specialty areas and conditions treated
- ✓ Complete practice address with street, city, state, and zip code
- ✓ Contact information (phone, email where available, website)
- ✓ Professional biography
- ✓ Office hours and visit types (in-office, telemedicine)
- ✓ Licensed states for practice

## Challenges Encountered

### 1. Access Barriers to Major Directories

**Challenge:** The three primary recommended directories (IFM, ABOIM, Academic Consortium) implement strong anti-bot protections and authentication requirements.

**Specific Issues:**
- **IFM Website:** Cloudflare protection blocks automated access (HTTP 403 errors)
- **ABOIM Database:** Requires individual practitioner searches, no bulk listing
- **AIHM Directory:** Login required to view detailed practitioner profiles

**Impact:** Unable to extract practitioner lists directly from these databases

**Solution Implemented:**
- Conducted geographic-based web searches to identify practitioners
- Visited individual practice websites for data extraction
- Verified credentials through official practice websites
- Result: Successfully compiled comprehensive practitioner database through alternative methodology

### 2. Data Completeness Variations

**Challenge:** Individual practice websites vary significantly in information completeness.

**Common Missing Data:**
- Insurance acceptance details (most require contacting office)
- Languages spoken (rarely listed)
- Years of experience (not always specified)
- Patient ratings/reviews (limited availability on practice sites)
- Photos/headshots (privacy considerations)

**Solution:** 
- Documented what information was available
- Marked fields as "Not specified" or "Contact office for details" where appropriate
- Prioritized data that was verifiable and publicly available
- Maintained data integrity by not inferring information

### 3. Healthcare Privacy Protections

**Challenge:** Healthcare directories implement privacy protections to prevent data scraping.

**Rationale:** Protects patient privacy and practitioner information
**Industry Standard:** Common across all major healthcare directories
**Ethical Consideration:** Respected these protections and used only publicly available information from official practice websites
