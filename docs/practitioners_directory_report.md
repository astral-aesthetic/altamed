## 6. Data Quality and Limitations

### Strengths
1. **Verified Sources**: All practitioners sourced from reputable, established medical directories
2. **Real Practitioners**: All are currently practicing physicians with verifiable credentials
3. **Comprehensive Data**: Multiple data points collected for each practitioner
4. **Geographic Diversity**: Coverage across 7 states spanning multiple US regions
5. **Specialty Diversity**: Wide range of specialties represented in both DO and ND categories

### Limitations
1. **Contact Information**: Direct phone numbers and emails not always publicly available in source directories
2. **Insurance Details**: Specific insurance plans accepted require direct verification with each practice
3. **Photos**: Practitioner photos not included in the dataset
4. **Real-Time Updates**: Practice information may change; users should verify directly with practitioners
5. **Geographic Gaps**: Limited representation from central and southern US states (focus on coastal states where naturopathic medicine is more established)
6. **Patient Ratings**: Available primarily for DOs via Healthgrades; most ND profiles lack ratings

### Data Quality Notes
- All contact information marked as "Available via [Source]" should be accessed through the source directory
- Insurance acceptance is generalized; specific plans must be verified with providers
- Years of experience calculated from graduation dates where available
- Telehealth availability reflects data as of compilation date (October 2025)
