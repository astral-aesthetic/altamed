#### 3. Updated Timestamp

**Value:** 2025-10-16 22:45:23.211396+00  
**Purpose:** Tracks when the record was last modified

---

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema Considerations

**Website Field Type:** `text`
- Single text field, not an array
- Stores the primary/official provider website URL
- Most important link for patients to book appointments

**Bio Field Type:** `text`
- Flexible text field for practitioner biography
- Suitable for additional information like extra website links
- Maintains readability with structured formatting

### Design Decision: Why Not Store All URLs in Website Field?

**Rationale:**
1. **Primary Action Focus:** The `website` field is typically used for the main booking/appointment link
2. **User Experience:** Having one clear primary URL prevents confusion
3. **Additional Context:** The bio field allows us to provide context for additional links (personal site, wellness platform)
4. **Future Extensibility:** If multiple websites become common, the schema can be updated to use a JSONB array
